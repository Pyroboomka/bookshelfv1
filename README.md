This is my sample project where I tried to understand how React-redux ecosystem works.

It's a books 'todolist'. Add books, edit books, delete books, search books. That's all.

Don't do this magic with index.js files and folders, it's very bad for your mental health and the guy who reviews it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
